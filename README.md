# Getting Input
Automatically retrieving custom puzzle input from AoC requires setting a session cookie for the application to use.
[How to get the session cookie](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1)
tldr: Browser console -> Network -> open/refresh puzzle input page -> read session cookie from request header

The session cookie (without 'session=') has to be copied into a file called 'sessioncookie.txt' in the project's root folder.

# Personal Goals
This year I set myself some specific goals to achieve while solving the puzzles:
- Program generic solutions that should work for every puzzle input
- Get more familiar with regular expressions, especially for parsing inputs
- Learn to use python's collections library
